## About the challenges

The Eclipse Software Defined Vehicle (SDV) Hackathon is back — now happening in two locations in parallel, enabling participants from across Europe to collaborate and innovate together! The event will be fully streamed between both venues, ensuring seamless interaction and shared energy. Each location will have its own Hack MC, a team of Hack Coaches, and dedicated support staff to keep things running smoothly.

The main purpose of the SDV Hackathon is to bring together automotive software enthusiasts to experiment with SDV tools and blueprints, build exciting new features, explore emerging technologies, and — most importantly — have fun while coding!

Over the course of two and a half days, you’ll be guided by coaches from leading OEMs, Tier 1 suppliers, and automotive tech companies including ETAS, Microsoft, Elektrobit Automotive, Eteration, and Red Hat. The hackathon features two tracks: SDV Tooling and SDV Blueprints — where experienced coaches will help you bring innovative, real-world use cases to life on top of open-source automotive software projects.

## Who can join

This hackathon is open to all. Whether you are a student just starting with coding or you are an experienced software developer and interested in hacking the challenges of automotive software, you are welcome to join the quest!

Make sure to attend and get hands-on experience on our open source tools and projects.

If you are still not acquainted with open source and SDV, it will be useful to check out our current [SDV Projects](https://sdv.eclipse.org/projects/) and get to know what you can expect.
